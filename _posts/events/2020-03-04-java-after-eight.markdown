Many projects are still on Java 8 and yet, Java 14 is out soon! The
small releases after 9 created the illusion of nothing much happening,
but nothing could be further from the truth - a lot changed since then
that shapes the look of everyday Java code:

* new language features like records, switch expressions, `var`, and
text blocks
* new APIs like stack walking and the reactive HTTP/2 client
* additions to existing APIs, like `Stream` and `Optional`

In this talk, we'll take a simple Java 8 code base, update it to 14, and
refactor it to use the new language features and APIs. You'll be
surprised how much the code changes!
