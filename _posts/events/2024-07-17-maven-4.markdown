All you need to know about Maven 4

Maven is more than 20 years old, and it's last major version (Maven 3) was released in 2010. Since then Maven got several great updates, but the Maven team also realized that Maven can't evolve further without huge changes which have the capability to break the whole ecosystem if done wrong. But after years of intensive planning and coding the release of Maven 4 is closer than ever before!
In this talk I'll speak about the motivation and challenges the team had while developing Maven 4 and of course about its new features and improvements.
