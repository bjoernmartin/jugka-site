In the latest years, there has been some push-back against frameworks, and more specifically annotations: some call them magic. Obviously, they make understanding the flow of the application harder.

Spring and Spring Boot latest versions go along this trend, by offering an additional way to configure beans with explicit code instead of annotations. It's declarative in the sense it looks like configuration, though it's based on Domain-Specific Language(s).

This talk aims to demo a step-by-step process to achieve that.
