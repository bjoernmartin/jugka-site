In this session I will walk you through how to build your own retro handheld console that is powered by Java, runs on a Raspberry Pi, and is printed on a 3D printer.  Some of the topics that we will cover along the journey include:

 *  Hacking Java on the Raspberry Pi
 *  Rigging input devices with Pi4J
 *  Insane performance tuning on the JVM
 *  Why your boss (or SO) needs to buy you a 3D printer!

And of course your retro gaming mettle will be put to the test, so make sure to dust off your old 8 and 16 bit consoles to prepare.

This presentation is about the most fun you can have while still legitimately calling this conference “work”. In fact, I will hopefully inspire you to do your own creative “work” leveraging Java and Raspberry Pi to hack the real world.
