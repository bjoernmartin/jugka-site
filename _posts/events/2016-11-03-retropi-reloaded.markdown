The RetroPi is a custom-designed handheld console using a Raspberry Pi with a pure Java software stack for emulation and graphics.  In this rework of the original RetroPi console, we go broader and bigger!

While 8-bit consoles like the NES are a lot of fun, the C64 (Commodore 64) was a real hacker’s machine.  And 3D printing is suitable for building a small handheld console, but what if you want to automate prototyping of a full-size arcade console?

In this talk we update the RetroPi to support C64 applications and emulate the C64 Joystick using the Pi4J library.  Also, we convert the design to use a wood enclosure milled with a CNC Router. CNC Routers are the analog of 3D printers with the ability to remove material with full automation and repeatability. They are also available in many different formats allowing detailed engraving or large format cutting to build things in life size.

This presentation is the most fun you can have while still legitimately “working” and will hopefully inspire you to start hacking the real world with Raspberry Pi and Java.
