We'll first take a quick look at how the JDK 7 Updates Project in OpenJDK works, how to track changes, and follow along as e.g. the Mac OS X Port gets integrated into future JDK 7 update releases. Then we'll switch gears, take a deep breath, and dive into some of the planned features of the next Java SE Platform, JDK 8 - modularity, lambdas, and more!
