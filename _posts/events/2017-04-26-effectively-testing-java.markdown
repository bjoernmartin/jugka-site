The Java ecosystem has myriads of libraries and projects that can be used to create the features our customers require, there's no shortage of options everywhere you look when it comes to writing production code. But what about testing code? If you ascribe to the Clean Code ideals then you know that testing code is as important as production code. Luckily there are a good number of libraries that can be used with popular testing frameworks. In this session we'll discover how to write better parameterized tests; take care of concurrency related events; spy/mock/stub out collaborators to ensure cleaner and isolated tests; fake out REST APIs to test out client code; fake out REST clients to test out server code, and more.
